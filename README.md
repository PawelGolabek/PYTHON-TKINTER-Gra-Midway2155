Pandora: Fleet Command is a space fleet combat simulation game made with python tkinter.

- Custom game vs AI

My goal was to make a game that feels like Aurora 4x or Command series look like without their complexity and realism. I wanted the complex look of the command centre UI, but with all of it feeling simple, natural and utilitarian.

Treat it as a little passion project with small target audience.
