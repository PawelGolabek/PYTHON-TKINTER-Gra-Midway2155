	descriptionLong = They chastened us for telling the Truth. The menace is there. Our faith was there as they refused to recognize His creation. 
        For Sarathaya's sake, our course remains unchanged. Daemons ascended from the depths only to be punished. For human life is not one to pity, our path leads forward.
