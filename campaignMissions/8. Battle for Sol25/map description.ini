	descriptionLong = We never saw her coming. Discordia's Echelon dancing in the shadows. There is something she seeks, yet she'd never admit it. She won't say what the goal of her journey is, not blackmailed nor tortured. Unless the thing she's searching for turns out to be real.
		Her scouts should not be there. Our friend knew that we are here. They came with a message. We can let go or fight to death. If she could just listen to a reason. The only thing she will find is a dead dream. She is chasing ghosts. Aren't we all?
