	descriptionShort = Our archenemy returned, as we warned    
	descriptionLong = The portal was there, reopened already. Someone left it to break spread. Was it godess of dark? Or the one we've once called as our father found a way to tear his way from the inside?
		Hemera is here, by my side. I see it. Her resolve. Her will to follow as blade companion. Our combined light will illuminate the darkest depths of Tartarus.
		As our path towards the darkness continues, Dollos resistance will grow stronger. His traps become more insidious. Still under Helios protection, we fight. We fight till the first morning light sets the air of Acheron on fire.
