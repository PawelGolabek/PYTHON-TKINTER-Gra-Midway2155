	descriptionLong = The wrath of Helios descended upon us for daring to utter the unspeakable truth. The ominous presence of a malevolent force threatened to unravel all of creation. Our steadfast devotion to Eusebia's artistry was met with disdain and disbelief. Yet, in reverence to the great Mother Nyx, I remain steadfast in my purpose. 
		The Dollos Daemons, brought forth from the eternal darkness, were swiftly met with punishment. But the suffering of mortal lives holds no sway over me. 
		My path leads ever onward, even if it means venturing once more into the pit of Hades itself, where unspeakable horrors lurk and wait to claim the minds of the unwary.
