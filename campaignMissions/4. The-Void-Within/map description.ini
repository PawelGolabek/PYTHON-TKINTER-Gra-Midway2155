	descriptionLong = Behold, Discordia's Echelon slinks in the shadows, an enigmatic presence veiled in mystery. Her desire for an unknown goal remains cloaked, impervious to even the most harrowing of interrogations. But, should her quest prove to be true, only then will she divulge its nature.
		Surprisingly, her scouts approached where they should not. Once a cherished companion, alas, she now approaches us with hostile intentions. She knew of our presence, and delivered an ultimatum: Surrender, or fight until the end. If only she would listen to a reason, for in the end, she will find nothing but a lifeless fantasies. The ghosts she seeks, as we all do in our own ways.
