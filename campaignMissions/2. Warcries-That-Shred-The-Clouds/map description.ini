	descriptionShort = Our archenemy returned, as we warned    
	descriptionLong = The reopening of the transdimensional portal was a harbinger of the impending cataclysm. 
		Was it the hand of the Goddess of Dark that had rent the veil of reality, or had the once venerated Father succeeded in breaking through the fabric of space and time? Hemera stood steadfast by my side, her unwavering resolve a shining light in the face of the oncoming darkness. Together, our might would dispel the shadows that shrouded the depths of Tartarus.
		As we delved deeper into the chasm, the cunning Dollos demons increased their resistance. Our blades were raised high as we marched towards the inevitable confrontation. 
		The fate hung in the balance as the dawn approached, ready to dispel the shadows of Acheron with its radiant light.
